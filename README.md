          * At first, users are taken to a landing page where they have the option     of logging in or creating a new account.
          * Upon login, users can view their dashboard which has inks to their followers, following, posts, and timeline. They can also see their news feed which consists of posts in chronological order from all the people they are following.
          * Users can view and follow new users from the recommended follow list.
          * Users can submit a new post that displays on their newsfeed either by clicking on the top navbar pencil button or the input field at the top of their feed.
          * Users can repost a particular post, which will then be displayed on their timeline.
          * Users can favorite a particular post that they like or want to save for later.
          * Users can then click the favorites tab to view all their favorites. They can unfavorite a post as well.
          * Users can use the search bar to search for a hashtag or a username by using the # or @ symbol before their text input. The matching results will be displayed in blue for the user.
          * Users can click on a username or user thumbnail to go to that user timeline.
          * Users can click on the following or followers tab to see a list of those people. From there they can choose to unfollow or refollow a person if they want.
          * Users can view a list of the most used hashtags in the trending list. If a user submits a new post that includes one of the trending hashtags, that word's count will update in the trending list.
          * Users can directly message a user either on their timeline or from the recommended follow list.
          When users follow another user, that target user receives a new notification.
          * Users can minimize the recommended follow list and trending hashtag list if they want to clear up space.
